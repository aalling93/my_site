about_me ="""  
I'm Kristian. 
In the vast and mysterious ocean of data, I captain my research vessel at the Center for Security at DTU. 
My passion? Unraveling the secrets hidden in satellite imagery and illuminating the shadowy world of dark vessel detection.

With an anchor in AI and a compass guided by innovation, my journey is all about making the maritime realm safer and smarter. 
Picture me as your digital maritime detective, where algorithms and ocean waves meet to safeguard our seas.

Whether charting new courses in artificial intelligence or diving deep into the depths of data analysis, 
my portfolio is a testament to a voyage where technology harmonizes with the rhythm of the waves. 
Come aboard and let's set sail on an expedition where each discovery is a step towards a safer maritime future!"
