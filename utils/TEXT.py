about_me = """  
Hello there! I'm currently immersed in the fascinating world of maritime surveillance and security as a PhD researcher at the Center for Security, National Space Institute of Denmark, at the Technical University of Denmark. My daily adventures involve delving into, e.g., satellite data and AI to detect and analyze vessels, especially those elusive ones without their AIS transponders on.

My role is a blend of detective and tech wizardry: I capture satellite images and DAS measurements, identify ships (with a keen eye for the 'dark' ones), and predict their movements and states using the power of AI. In simpler words, I'm a bit like a maritime sleuth, using cutting-edge technology to ensure the safety and security of our seas.

When I'm not tracking ships or decoding data, I enjoy the challenges of programming, mainly in Python and occasionally in Julia. My approach to coding is all about efficiency, clarity, and thorough testing – ensuring that every line of code is as reliable as it is understandable.



When I step away from my desk, I'm equally passionate about immersing myself in the great outdoors. Whether it's hiking through serene landscapes, sailing on the open sea, or just enjoying a quiet evening under the stars, I find these moments perfect for recharging and finding inspiration.

I'm a firm believer in the balance of mind and body, so staying active is important to me. Be it a morning run, a weekend bike ride, or just a stroll through the park, staying physically active helps keep my mind sharp and focused.

That's a little about me – a maritime security researcher, nature lover, coding enthusiast, bookworm, and fitness advocate. I'm always on the lookout for new adventures, both in my professional field and in life!
