                  """  Ships may be found by different types of satellite sensors including Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR), multispectral, Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) and RF electronic support systems. Several methods are described for detecting, classifying, and identify (ID) ships as well as discriminating them from, e.g., icebergs. For example, AIS data can be used in combination with other sensors both for annotation and for finding dark ships, i.e., ships that have turned off their transponder. The sensor fusion, data combination and matching of various sensor data spatially and temporally are then important. We analyze methods and results for various combinations of sensor data, where we use deep neural networks on annotated datasets for detection, classification, discrimination and ID of ships. """,]

              """ This article presents a methodology for localizing radio frequency interference (RFI) signals in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from Sentinel-1 SAR satellites. RFI are caused by on-ground radars, and their detection and localization thus provide valuable information for decision makers. In this study, an unsupervised deep learning model based on a Convolutional Autoencoder is used to detect and localize RFI signals in SAR images. The CAE reconstructs the SAR images, excluding RFI signals and other large-scale anomalies. Anomalies are detected by comparing the original images with their reconstructions, and a secondary classi- fication scheme is used to identify RFI signals among the detected anomalies. Results show that the proposed method detects and localizes RFI signals, even in complex regions. The automatic localization of RFI signals in SAR images can enhance various applications such as maritime domain awareness and border surveillance. """,]

               """Non-cooperative vessels pose a challenge to traditional mar- itime surveillance systems. To overcome this challenge, alter- native surveillance methods such as space-based monitoring sensors have been employed. However, the time-consuming process of satellite downlink hampers near-real-time appli- cations. To address these issues, the use of onboard Artifi- cial Intelligence for direct data processing has emerged as a key technology. This study explores the implementation of a lightweight Synthetic Aperture Radar ship detection model inspired by YOLOv8. The model achieves promising results on an annotated data-set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach for detecting both small and large ships. The study investigates the impact of atrous and depth-wise convo- lutions on the model’s performance and explores model quan- tization for further size reduction. Our final model has 0.3 million parameters and reached an average procession of 95.4 %. The results highlight the potential of lightweight models for onboard ship detection, offering comparable accuracy to larger models. """,]

                    """ Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images are used increasingly more for Earth observation. While SAR images are useable in most conditions, they occasionally experience image degradation due to interfering signals from external radars, called radio frequency interference (RFI). RFI-affected images are often discarded in further analysis or preprocessed to remove the RFI. However, few on-ground radars can cause RFI in SAR images and such information can thus increase domain awareness greatly over both land and sea, where, e.g., localizing and characterizing RFI signals in the ocean could help classify otherwise overlooked ships. The aim of the current study is to detect and localize RFI signals automatically in Sentinel-1 level- 1 images and further characterize the on-ground radar. The spatial structure of RFI signals vary greatly. A convolutional autoencoder (CAE) was therefore developed to reconstruct RFI- free Sentinel-1 images. Conversely, RFI-affected images could not be well reconstructed. Anomalous heatmaps were then developed to automatically detect and localize RFI anomalies in the images under varying environmental and geographical conditions, whereafter the external radar characteristics were extracted manually from Sentinel-1 level-0 data. We could con- sequently classify and localize RFI signals believed to originate from both stationary radars and ship-borne radars. We further argue that the calculated ship-borne radar characteristics corre- spond to those of air-surveillance radars. Empirically, the method showed better detection results than those of previous studies. Our study shows that more information can be extracted from certain detected objects, such as ships, from SAR images. """,]

                           """ Maritime surveillance of the Arctic region is of growing importance as shipping,fishing and tourism are increasing due to the sea ice retreat caused by global warming. Ships that do not identify themselves with a transponder system, so-called dark ships, pose a security risk. They can be detected by SAR satellites, which can monitor the vast Arctic region through clouds, day and night, with the caveat that the abundant icebergs in the Arctic cause false alarms. We collect and analyze 200 Sentinel-1 horizontally polarized SAR scenes from areas with high maritime traffic and from the Arctic region with a high density of icebergs. Ships and icebergs are detected using a continuous wavelet transform, which is optimized by correlating ships to known AIS positions. Globally, we are able to assign 72% of the AIS signals to a SAR ship and 32% of the SAR ships to an AIS signal. The ships are used to construct an annotated dataset of more than 9000 ships and ten times as many icebergs. The dataset is used for training several convolutional neural networks, and we propose a new network which achieves state of the art performance compared to previous ship–iceberg discrimination networks, reaching 93% validation accuracy. Furthermore, we collect a smaller test dataset consisting of 424 ships from 100 Arctic scenes which are correlated to AIS positions. This dataset constitutes an operational Arctic test scenario. We find these ships harder to classify with a lower test accuracy of 83%, because some of the ships sail near icebergs and ice floes, which confuses the classification algorithms. """,]
ship_velocity = ["pages/publications/ship_velocity.png",
                 """  SAR satellites are used for monitoring ships worldwide. Moving ships are Doppler shifted by an amount proportional to their velocity. An offset between the ship and its wake is then produced during SAR processing. We present a novel automatic method for calculating the ship velocity. The method relies on multitask deep learning to estimate the offset and ship heading. From these parameters, the ship velocity can be obtained. A convolutional neural network is trained using a coupled loss function. The loss function allows both parameters to be estimated at the same time. We show the methods’ effectiveness for ships in Sentinel-1 SAR images. For this purpose, a large dataset of 30,000 AIS annotated SAR ship images is collected. These images have 20 × 22 m pixel resolution and ships do not have a clear wake. The AIS provides the true ship velocity and allows the method to be evaluated. As a result, we can determine the ship speed with an accuracy of 1.1 m/s. The offset disappears near the azimuth direction of the SAR image. Yet, our method is reliable except for ships sailing within 2.5 degrees of the azimuth direction. """,]

                       """ Subsurface ocean measurements are extremely sparse and irregularly distributed, narrowing our ability to describe deep ocean processes and thus also limiting our understanding of the role of ocean and marine ecosystems in the Earth system. To overcome these observational limitations, neural networks combining remotely-sensed surface measurements and in situ vertical profiles are increasingly being used to retrieve high-quality three-dimensional estimates of the ocean state. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the reconstruction of vertical profiles of temperature and salinity starting from surface observation-based data. The model is trained on satellite and in situ data collected between 2005 and 2020 in the Atlantic Ocean. Rather than using spatially gridded in situ observations, we use directly measured vertical profiles. Different combinations of surface variables are analyzed and compared in order to determine the most effective inputs for the CNN. Furthermore, the relative importance of each of these variables in the vertical reconstruction is assessed using Shapley values, originally developed in the framework of cooperative game theory. The model performance is shown to be superior to current state-of-the-art methods and the same approach can easily be extended to other basins or to the global ocean.""",]
