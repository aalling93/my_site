With object detection algorithms applied on satellite images, localizing, e.g., the saboteur ship. The ship was found several weeks after the incident, since this was done with earlier object detection models. The models used were run in two-stages, and therefore have very high inference time. In this bachelor thesis, I implement a You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 5 model for fast, real-time ship detection on high resolution optical satellite images. By acquiring a custom data-set from the Planetscope dove constellation a YOLOv5s model is trained to detect three classes: ships, clouds and wakes. The YOLOv5s model achieved a mAP@0.5 = 0.555 for all classes and an ship detection precision of 77%. During inference, the model reached 31FPS, meaning that the model could process 31 pictures of size 3400x3400x3 every second. The model is very well suited to be implemented for near-real-time object detection on optical satellite images, providing a high precision with a very high FPS. Meaning that the next time there is an incident, using our model, the right authorities could potentially act upon the incident while it is being done, in contrast to only being able to react several weeks after an incidents occurrence. However, the model is limited by weather conditions.",]
Frederik_gade_Bsc = ["pages/supervised_projects/figs/Bsc_Frederik_gade.png","Information regarding Dark Ships is increasingly needed. Ships can usually be identi­ fied by their Automated Identification System (AIS) signal, but so­called Dark Ships turn their AIS transponder off. This project focuses on a first attempt to match ships found by Navigational Radar Detector (NRD) (mentioned as Radio Frequency (RF) in this report) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images through AIS. Four different algorithms are tested and compared on two different data sets. The two best algorithms yield very simi­ lar results with only minor differences. When testing on a data set from Western Norway, with RF data from UnseenLabs, AIS data provided by GateHouse, and SAR images from Sentinel­1, 47 out of a possible 96 triple matches are found with mean distances between AIS/RF being 1264 metres and 424 metres for AIS/SAR matches. When testing on a data set from Northern Norway, with RF data provided by DALO from the NorSat­3 satellite, 13 out of 16 possible triple matches are found, with a higher AIS/RF distance of 2125 metres, which might be partly explained by the random errors provided in the data, and a very similar distance between AIS/SAR of 484 metres. All algorithms are also assessed with visual inspections, showing an advantage of the same two algorithms again. Improve­ ments are suggested and it is concluded that two of the four algorithms are not suited for matching ships. The two remaining algorithms work well but need human supervision to ensure all matches are meaningful."]
Hasse_Bsc = ["pages/supervised_projects/figs/Bsc_Hasse.png",""" The purpose of this thesis is to examine different approaches for finding pirate ships in the Gulf of Guinea. Here is AIS, Sentinel­1 and Sentinel­2 data investigated and evaluated. The English Channel is used as a test bed for the different methods and algorithms used, and the performance is compared to the Gulf of Guinea.
AIS data is provided by Gatehouse Maritime which is downloaded through their database with the aid of a Python script. Sentinel­1 data is acquired from ASF Alaska which provides both unprocessed and processed data over the chosen area. The Sentinel­2 data is acquired from the Copernicus Open Access Hub, which provides easy accessible data.
Different methods and techniques are presented in how dark ship determination are evaluated in the different approaches. An AIS framework for detecting dark ships was made, finding 350 dark ships from 5 months of data in the English Channel and 295 dark ships from 3 days of data in the Gulf of Guinea. This corresponds to an accuracy of 6% in the English Channel and 12% in the Gulf of Guinea.
Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection algorithm have been used on both SAR and MSI to detect ships, where detections in MSI has been optimized using K­means clustering. The Sentinel­ 1 found 31.5% of the detections in the English Channel to be dark ships and 66% of the detections in the Gulf of Guinea to be dark ships. For Sentinel­2 was 22% of the ships found in the English Channel to be dark ships and in the Gulf of Guinea were 11% of the ships found dark ships. The K­means clustering increased the performance of the CA­CFAR by 4% in the English Channel."""]
Hjalte_Bsc = ["pages/supervised_projects/figs/Bsc_Hjalte.png","""In this project, a gradient boosting model is used to predict if a ship arrives at a specific port using AIS data from GateHouse Maritime in a binary setup. The data is from a region around the Baltic and North seas and only includes cargo ships. Both static and dynamic messages are used for the predictions. As the setup is binary, the model has been trained on each port in the data set. The model shows able to predict the arrival of ships with a f1­score of 0.83 for the port of Kiel, the largest in the data set, but the performance varies from port to port. Several factors seems to affect the performance, like the size of the port, the accuracy of the static messages for the port, and if other, larger ports are in the vicinity of the one considered. All in all, the model seems able to assist in predicting if ships arrive at a specific port, but the imbalanced binary setup makes it so relatively few misclassified negative observations are needed to make noise in the positive classifications.

This thesis investigates the tandem use of multi­spectral remote sensing and machine learning for prediction of wildfires and detection of wildfires and burnt areas. This begins with a study of available space borne instruments suited for this project. Hereafter a methodological approach to machine learning is utilized to find the machine learning models best suited for three models. It is found that a simple linear regressor shows promise for the prediction of wildfires. Principal component analysis together with decision tree and adaptive boosting methods show great results in active fire detection, achieving precision of > 99% in some cases with good avoidance of false positives. However the results of the burnt area detection are disappointing and concluded to be due to limitations of multi­spectral imagers."]

Ships are required to identify themselves using radio transponders, however when these transponders are turned off, other means of identifying ships must be used. In this project, neural networks are used to identify ships using sentinel-2 SAR-satellite images. Details about ships such as their length, width and type are extracted from the images by the neural networks. An algorithm is set up that can search through a database of known ships and compare data about them to the estimated features to help identify the ship in the satellite image."""]

Performance in localization is evaluated using the intersection between ascending and descending RFIs.

Constantin_Msc = ["pages/supervised_projects/figs/Msc_Constantin.png",""" Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays an increasing role in satellite-based ship detection and hereby enhances maritime security in all weather conditions, day and night. This paper specifically addresses so-called dark ships (ships without AIS signal), through the analysis of high-resolution ICEYE SAR imagery. Leveraging sophisticated deep learning models like YOLOv8, our proposed framework achieves a detection rate surpassing 85%, and thereby bridges the gap to the extensive existing knowledge about ship detection in low-resolution imagery.
Our contribution extends beyond the model architecture itself, encompassing a comprehensive pipeline essential for the deploy- ment of the model in future military scenarios. This framework includes components such as result filtering, AIS signal matching, and supplementary metadata collection. By elucidating these aspects, this paper provides a holistic understanding of the dark ship detection process, advancing the application of cutting-edge technology in the context of maritime security."""]
